        <!-- Farmer Network Section -->
        <section id="farmers">
            <h2>Farmer Network</h2>
            <p>Namba Coffee Estate is more than a farm—we serve as a cooperative hub for hundreds of smallholder farmers. We provide training on agronomy, harvesting, and processing, and we guarantee traceability and fair pricing for their cherries. Through our partnership model, farmers deliver ripe cherries to our washing station where they are weighed, pulped, and processed with care.</p>
            <p>We believe in transparency and community, and we proudly share stories from our farmers. Here are a few testimonials:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Jane Mwangi:</strong> “With Namba Coffee Estate I learned better pruning techniques and now my yields have doubled.”</li>
                <li><strong>Peter Njoroge:</strong> “I receive fair payments on time and know exactly where my coffee ends up.”</li>
            </ul>

        <!-- Processing Section -->
        <section id="processing">
            <h2>Processing &amp; Quality Control</h2>
            <p>Quality begins at the washing station. Cherries are sorted, pulped and fermented in clean tanks, then washed and soaked in fresh water. We dry our coffee on raised beds under the sun, constantly turning and covering it at night to ensure even drying. Once dried to the right moisture content, the coffee is hulled, graded, and stored under controlled conditions until export.</p>
            <p>Our quality control team monitors each stage of processing. We cup every lot and only the finest coffees are selected for auction or direct export. Our dedication to excellence ensures that every cup delivers the distinctive Kenyan profile that buyers love.</p>
